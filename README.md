# Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
# Overview of efforts
In this project, I have applied basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. First, I have explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, I split the data into testing and training subsets, and determined a suitable performance metric for this problem.Then analyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This enables me to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, I have tested this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to your statistics.
# Software and Libraries



This project requires the following software and Python libraries:

### Software
- **Python**: A programming language used for this project.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application for creating and sharing documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

### Python Libraries
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computing in Python.
- **pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning.
- **matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**:    Python visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

# Starting the Project

This project contains the following files:

- **linear regression(Boston House price).ipynb**: This is the main Jupyter Notebook file where you will be performing your work on the project. It includes the code and analysis for predicting Boston housing prices using linear regression.
- **Boston_Housing.csv**: The dataset used for this project. It contains information about housing prices and features in Boston.

## Running the Jupyter Notebook

To start working with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**:
   - On **Windows**, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   - On **macOS** or **Linux**, use the Terminal.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Use the `cd` command to change to the directory containing the project files. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
